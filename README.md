#Count the Homeless 2016
##Los Angeles


Notes:

LA divivded into Service Provider Areas.

Largest homeless count in the country.
All of Los Angeles except Long Beach, Glendale and Pasadena (they do their own counts)
6000 volunteers over 3 days and 4 nights

These are the official numbers used by policy makers, service providers, and the US congress!

number 1 goal of the count is **accuracy**

Why? 

1. identify trends
2. brings funds
3. these are people, not numbers

Homeless count is one of the best ways to help.
